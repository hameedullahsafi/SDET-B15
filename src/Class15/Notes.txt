Methods in Java:
      is just a collection of java statements and blocks  of code like if else loop printlns etc.
      Why should we learn about methods:
      Binifite of Methods:
     1> it Allows us to simplify large code as we can divide the logic into smaller parts by creating methods for them
      build those methods one by one and later on combine them to build the complete application.
      2> Methods allow us to re-use code.
      3> Methods allow us to be flexible.
   How can we create Methods?
    There are two types built in and user defined .
    1> built - in methods?
    the methosd which are designed by java developers for example the println() nextInt() method in the Scanner
    class length() present in String class they are all built-in methods.
 User Defined Methods:
   they methods that we write.
  Methods which return something when called and others are methods which do not return anything when called

  int add ( int a, int b){
  return a+b;
  }
  int => is called return type of a method
  add=> it is called name of the method
  (int a,int b) is called parameters of the method or the input to the method
  { is called  body of the method
  }

  Rules:
  return type and the values that we are returning from a method should match

  we can only assign method to variables of same type.
  =============================================================
  There are three types of Variables with respect to their scope
  local variables:
  if a variable is created inside a block of code like a method, loop, if condition etc.
  if condition etc. they are called local variables.

  Upside:
  local variables occupy the memory for the shortest period of time you should always try to write code with the help of local
  variables.

  Downside:
  they can't be assessed outside of the block in which they are created . they have very limited scope.

  instance variables:
         All the variables which are created inside a class but outside of methods are called instance variables
   Upside:
   we can use them in all the instance methods of that class. their scope is larger than local variables.
    static variables:
    Downside :
    they stay longer in the memory as compared to local variables .
     All the variables which are outside of methods and have the static keywoord are called static variables.
