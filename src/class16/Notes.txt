There are three types of Variables with respect to their scope
  local variables:
  if a variable is created inside a block of code like a method, loop, if condition etc.
  if condition etc. they are called local variables.

  Upside:
  local variables occupy the memory for the shortest period of time you should always try to write code with the help of local
  variables.

  Downside:
  they can't be assessed outside of the block in which they are created . they have very limited scope.

  instance variables:
         All the variables which are created inside a class but outside of methods are called instance variables
   Upside:
   we can use them in all the instance methods of that class. their scope is larger than local variables.
    static variables:
    Downside :
    they stay longer in the memory as compared to local variables .
     All the variables which are outside of methods and have the static keywoord are called static variables.

upside:
 Static variables  only occupy one memory location from the RAM even though we create 1000 objects of that
 class
  2>they can be used in any block of code inside the class they can be accessed in any methods of a class
  3>they can also be accessed with the help of any object of that class. they have the most wide scope

  Downside:
    they are loaded int the memory when a class is loaded even though you don't use them

    ================================================================

    Access modifiers?
     Access modifiers are some keywords in java that we can to control the access of
     variables, methods and classes

  there are 4 access leveals private, protected, default, public
  and  there are 3 keywords that we use to control this access for example private protected and public
  Private:
   if we write private keyword with a bariable or a method or a class, we can assess that variable or method
   or class within the same class.

   default:
    deafult is not a keyword. when we don't any access modifiers with variables or methods or classes
    default access is applied automatically by java, which means these variable methods or classes can be
    access inside any other class which is present inside the some package,

 public:
   public is a keyword , when writtent with any bariable or method or class it means any classin your project can access these things.
