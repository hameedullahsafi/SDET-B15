OOP (object oriented programming):
it;s just a way of writing code. that follows certain rules or guidelines . we create classes that have attributes/ properties/
fields and methods/funtion/behaviourism.
 why we should we learn OOP?
 1) it simplifies the software development and maintenace (adding new features changing the existing code).
 2)code duplication is reduced.
 3) it also helps us represent something from real life with the help of class
 and objects.

 Class:
     it is a blueprint or a design from which actual reallife objects are created. computer uses  avlass to check what that class can do
     for example: Scanner scan=new Scanner(System.in) Here Scanner is class. scan is an object of scanner class. with the help of object we can use
     the methods from a class we can also use properties from that class
     Object:
     object are created from classes and we can use them to call methods and the properites
